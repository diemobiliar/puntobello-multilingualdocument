# PuntoBello Multilingual Listview Command Set

## Summary
This ListView Command set is designed to be used in a document library to manage the creation or deletion of language connections between documents.

![List view command set in action](../assets/lang-connection.gif)

### _Notes_
* The fields `pb_LangConn`, `pb_LangCd` must be present and the listview command set must be enabled in your document library
* This solution depends on [PuntoBello multilingual field customizer](../puntobello-multilingualdocument-field/) to render the connections correctly
* Uses [PnP JS](https://pnp.github.io/pnpjs/) library for all interactions with SharePoint.

### Features
With this ListView Command Set, you can :
- Set the language connection between two or more documents or add another document to a set of linked documents
- Remove the language connection of a specific document that has been already linked

_Note_: All linked documents must be of the same file type.

The command set performs various checks to ensure that a language connection or removal is allowed:
- Verifies if the documents are of the same file type.
- Checks if you are trying to link documents with the same language code (e.g., two English documents).
- Checks if you are trying to add a document for a language code that already exists in this specific set.

### Parameters
You can configure all the parameters in the corresponding files located in the `env` directory. Once set, build the solution accordingly.
