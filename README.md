# PuntoBello multilingual documents

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to group SharePoint documents that are available in multiple languages. These grouped documents, along with their language variations, are then automatically displayed in a web part.

## Use Case
This project is designed for scenarios where you have documents that have been translated into various languages. These documents are related because they are different versions of the same content in different languages. Using the solutions provided in this repository, you can group these related documents. Once grouped, the documents and their translations will be automatically rendered and displayed in a web part, allowing users to easily access the different language versions.

## PuntoBello Artifacts
All lists and fields associated with the PuntoBello solution are prefixed with `pb_`

## Structure
This project consists of three SharePoint SPFx solutions:
1. [PuntoBello Field Customizer](./puntobello-multilingualdocument-field/README.md)
2. [PuntoBello Listview](./puntobello-multilingualdocument-listview/README.md)
3. [PuntoBello Webpart](./puntobello-multilingualdocument-spwp/README.md)

You can find additional information in each respective repository.

## Multilinguality
All the SPFx solutions are strongly focused on serving multilingual content. Our implementation pattern differs from the standard SPFx approach to enhance SharePoint's multilingual capabilities.

For example, content is always displayed in the specific language of the page. If you have a page translated into various languages, the content on each page will be rendered in that page's language, rather than the user's language, avoiding the mixing of different languages on the same page.

### Configuring / Translating Languages
You can translate all the text by adding or updating the files in the `loc` folder. The `default.js` file should always be present to ensure a default behavior for the component.

### Rendering of Text-Based Information
Text-based information is served from the `loc` folder, as is typical in SPFx solutions. Additionally, we have implemented a default language file (`default.js`), which will always be used if the corresponding user language file is not present in the SPFx solution.

### Gathering the User Language
The current user language is retrieved in two different ways, depending on the type of SPFx solution.

#### SPFx Solutions on a SharePoint Page
Typically web parts:
The language is gathered from the current page language if running in a multilingual SharePoint configuration or from the current site language. The content will be served in this language.

#### SPFx Solutions Outside of a SharePoint Page
Typically application customizers:
The language is gathered from the current `cultureUIName` (SPFx property `pageContext.cultureInfo.currentUICultureName`).

## Additional Configuration Possibilites
Across all the PuntoBello solutions, we have put considerable effort into enabling you to configure your solutions at build time, so that you can:

- Brand the solution with your specific colors, fonts, etc.
- Deploy the solutions easily on multiple tenants if needed (e.g., dev/test/prod environments).

We have also implemented a mini framework across all solutions, which you can easily extend with additional properties if you want to configure further aspects of the solutions.

## Minimal Path to Awesome

### Puntobello Installer

https://github.com/diemobiliar/puntobello-installer/ is configured as a submodule und provides a docker image containing build and deploy scripts for SPFx and SharePoint Scripts. When cloning this repository, include the submodule:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/diemobiliar/puntobello-multilingualdocument.git
```
Alternatively, configure the submodule after cloning the repository:

```shell
git submodule update --init
```

With the Puntobello Installer, there is the possibility to execute the installation of all artifacts in various variants. These are described below. They are:
- [Use Dev Container in VS code](#install_devcontainer)
- [Use commands in docker container locally](#install_docker)
- [Build and Deploy locally](#install_locally)

Alternatively, your own preferred methods can be used to build and deploy the solutions - see [Build and serve Webpart or Extension locally using nvm](#install_nvm).

### Prerequisites

> 📝 **NOTE:**
> The Dockerfile can be used for arm64 or amd64 CPU architectures. The architecture can be set to "arm64" or "amd64" in the devcontainer.json under build.args. The architecture can also be set using the `ARCH` argument for use with `docker build`. Only arm64 and amd64 are supported. It is set to amd64 if you don't change.

> 📝 **NOTE:**
> If the scripts are executed locally on the client and not in the Dev container, it must be ensured that the prerequisites for building SPFx solutions as well as the corresponding PowerShell modules are installed.

> 💡 **TIP:**
> In order to use the scripts you have to configure login mechanism and other parameters in `./.devcontainer/scripts/config.psm1` .Every authentication mechanism is based on the PnP.PowerShell examples. For setting up an Entra ID app registration and its corresponding API permissions, as well as the necessary permissions when using a user, consult the documentation: [Connect-PnPOnline](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/cmdlets/Connect-PnPOnline.html) and [Authentication](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/articles/authentication.html).

> ⚠️ **Caution:** Never commit files containing secrets or passwords!

### <a id="install_devcontainer"></a>Use Dev Container in VS code
The Visual Studio Code Dev Containers extension lets you use a container as a full-featured development environment.

> 💡 **TIP:**
> If you're interested in getting started with dev containers, you may find this [Dev Containers tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial) helpful. It provides step-by-step instructions to help you get up and running quickly.

#### Deploy SPO Sites and Lists
1. Use Ctrl + Shift + P (on Windows) or Command + Shift + P (on OS X) to run `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`.
This builds the container and attaches the project folder to the container with PowerShell and modules loaded.
2. Run `Deploy-SitesAndLists.ps1` to create the SPO sites and lists. The configuration is set in folder `spo`. If you want to change the target urls of sites and lists, change the configuration in the json files.

#### Build and Deploy Webpart and Extensions
1. Run `Build-SPWP.ps1` in the Dev Container to build the solutions. The script installs every dependencies and creates the sppkg files. These are saved in sharepoint/solution folder of each solution.
2. Install the solutions in SPO app catalog and sites with the script `Deploy-SPWP.ps1`. If you have them already installed, this script can be used to update the solutions as well.
3. Sites, Lists and Solutions are ready to use.

#### Connect the solution to SPO
If you want to test or debug a solution without deploying it in the app catalog, you can use gulp serve in the Dev Container.

> 📝 **NOTE:**
> The Dev container has configured the two default ports 4321 and 35729 for forwarding. If the configuration is different, corresponding parameters must be adjusted in the solutions as well as in the devcontainer.json.

1. Trust the dev certificate: `gulp trust-dev-cert`
2. Change to the directory of the solution e.g. `cd ./puntobello-multilingualdocument-spwp`.
3. Set the page urls in config/serve.json.
4. Start serving: `gulp serve`
5. Open the configured workbench url to test or debugging the solution.

### <a id="install_docker"></a>Use commands in docker container locally
1. Run `docker build` command to build the docker container from Dockerfile. Set build argument ARCH to desired CPU architecture (amd64 or arm64).<br>
```shell
docker build -t pbspfxtools --build-arg ARCH=amd64 -f ./.devcontainer/Dockerfile ./.devcontainer
```
2. Run the deploy script for SPO sites and lists.<br>
```shell
docker run -v ${PWD}:/spfx -w /spfx pbspfxtools pwsh -Command "Deploy-SitesAndLists.ps1"
```
3. Build the solutions using the build script in the docker container.<br>
```shell
docker run -v ${PWD}:/spfx -w /spfx pbspfxtools pwsh -Command "Build-SPWP.ps1"
```
4. Deploy the solutions to app catalog and sites using the deploy script in the docker container.<br>
```shell
docker run -v ${PWD}:/spfx -w /spfx pbspfxtools pwsh -Command "Deploy-SPWP.ps1"
```

### <a id="install_locally"></a>Build and Deploy locally
#### Deploy SPO Sites and Lists
1. Run `.\.devcontainer\scripts\Deploy-SitesAndLists.ps1` in the root of the project to create the SPO sites and lists. The configuration is set in folder `spo`. If you want to change the target urls of sites and lists, change the configuration in the json files.

#### Build and Deploy Webpart and Extensions
1. Run `.\.devcontainer\scripts\Build-SPWP.ps1` in to build the solutions. The script installs every dependencies and creates the sppkg files. These are saved in sharepoint/solution folder of each solution.
2. Install the solutions in SPO app catalog and sites with the script `.\.devcontainer\scripts\Deploy-SPWP.ps1`. If you have them already installed, this script can be used to update the solutions as well.
3. Sites, Lists and Solutions are ready to use.

### <a id="install_nvm"></a>Build and serve Webpart or Extension locally using nvm
#### Build and Deploy Webpart and Extensions
1. Change console to solution folder e.g. `cd ./puntobello-multilingualdocument-spwp`.
2. Run `nvm use` to set node version.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run pbship:dev` to build the solution or run `npm run start:dev` to serve for testing or debugging.
